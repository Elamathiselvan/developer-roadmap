# SPADE (Semantic Image Synthesis with SPADE) resource 

  Introduction:
        Semantic Image Synthesis with SPADE is a deep learning method for generating high-quality images from semantic label maps, which are essentially maps that associate each pixel in an image with a class label. SPADE stands for "Spatially-Adaptive Denormalization", which is a normalization technique that is used to improve the quality of the generated images.The paper "Semantic Image Synthesis with SPADE" was published in 2019 by researchers from NVIDIA, and it describes a novel approach to generative modeling that can be used to create high-quality images in a variety of styles and domains. The method is based on a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that is trained to map semantic label maps to realistic images.
