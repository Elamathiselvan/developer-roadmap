Introduction:
      Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative probabilistic model that is used in natural language processing to uncover the underlying topics in a large corpus of text. It is a popular technique for topic modeling, which involves identifying the topics present in a text corpus by analyzing the patterns of word co-occurrences in the corpus.There are many resources available for learning about LDA, including academic papers, books, tutorials, and online courses. Some useful resources for learning about LDA include:
