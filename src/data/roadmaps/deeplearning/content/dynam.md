#  Dynamic Programming with Approximation resource 

Introduction:

In the context of optimization problems, dynamic programming can be used to find the optimal solution by considering all possible solutions and choosing the one that results in the best outcome. However, in problems with a large number of possible solutions, it can be computationally expensive to consider all of them.Dynamic programming with approximation is a technique that can be used to solve optimization problems that have a large number of possible solutions. Dynamic programming is an algorithmic technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the results for future use.
