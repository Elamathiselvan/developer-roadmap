# Add Inverse Reinforcement Learning resource 
Introduction:

The goal of Add-IRL is to learn a reward function that can be used to train an agent to perform a task similar to the one observed from the expert. This is done by trying to find a reward function that explains the expert's behavior in terms of maximizing expected cumulative reward. Once the reward function is learned, it can be used to train a new agent that can perform the task with similar proficiency as the expert.Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns a reward function by observing the behavior of an expert in a given task. Additive Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Add-IRL) is a specific variation of IRL, where the agent learns an additive reward function, that is, a function that assigns a reward value to each state of the environment that is visited during the task.
